ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

- the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

- I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

- each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

- I can enter an event

- the text for that event is saved in local storage

- the saved events persist


NEED TO DO:

- Add current day to the heading of the page

- Create html divs for the time blocks

CSS STYLE CLASSES ALREADY CREATED:

- time blocks
    - past = grey (.past)
    - present = red (.present)
    - future = green (.future)

- save button .saveBtn 

- hour on left side of time block .hour


BRAIN DUMP:

- time blocks need to be inputs to add the event names in the block

- need to save the newly created event when save button is clicked 
    - .addEventListener --> "click"

- display the new event onto the screen once typed & override previous entry
    - save the input value to local storage when save button is pressed !!SEE ABOVE!!
        (localStorage.setItem & localStorage.getItem)

- if/else statement for the save button
    - if save button is pressed --> save input data in local storage & .textContent to display
    - if save button is not changed, then don't save to local stoage & do not display


- will need if/else statement to declare the time block status if it past/present/future
    - if time is in the past -- make class .past
    - if time is in the present -- make class .present
    - if time is in the future -- make class .future

- will need to declare a variable that is equal to the current time of day

- reminder: use many functions if needed & add parameters to carry over data!!
